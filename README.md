User HomePage
============

Dokuwiki plugin to automatically create user's homepage and/or namespace.
Previous authors stopped developing it in 2009.
I started to work on it in 2014-08.

TODO
Add options to select what to include in the string on event and possibly send a FontAwesome string if it is enabled.
